# Great Block War
 Evocraft project, by Samy and Tom for ESGI
 
 
# Goal of this project
 We made this project to understand and use the Multi-layer Perceptron into a Minecraft contest.
 Our school proposed us to participate in this project, to add some stakes to our codes and not just pass some school tests.
 
# How this works
 Our MLP work with 3 outputs, -0.5 , 0.5 and 1 (0 to don't do anything). There are 3 blocks who are fighting their direct neighbor on their right. <br/>
 If an ***Emerald Block*** fight a ***Diamond block*** then it die and transform itself in ***Redstone***. <br />
 If a ***Diamond block*** fight a ***Emerald Block***, then it win and transform itself in ***Glowstone***. <br/>
 <br/>
 If a block does not have any neighbor, then nothing happens.
 
# How to launch the script
 You need to launch an Evocraft server, then launch the script in a command line !
 Just be sure to be on coordinates 0,0,0 and it will work !
